#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: This file just makes some summary tables and graphs of the ABS data for the paper
# Author: Rohan Alexander
# Email: rohan.alexander@anu.edu.au
# Last updated: 19 March 2019
# Prerequisites: Need the data file from the ABS - electorates_ageSingleYears_sex_longform.csv.
# To do:
# - 
# Misc:
# -


#### Set up workspace ####
library(tidyverse)
# update.packages()


#### Read in the data ####
ABS_data <-
  read_csv("inputs/data/electorates_ageSingleYears_sex_longform.csv", skip = 8)
# The wonderful ABS allows us to download data in long format, so we only need to do some minor tidying and aggregating before we're ready to go.
names(ABS_data) <- c("division", "age", "sex", "number")
# Fill the rows and just keep the bits with content that we can work with
ABS_data <- ABS_data %>%
  fill(division, age) %>%
  filter(
