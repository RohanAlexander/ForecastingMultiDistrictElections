#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: This file just makes a simple MRP example, based on Kastellec, Lax, and Phillips (2016) 'Estimating State Public Opinion With Multi-Level Regression and Poststratification using R', but much more simple.

# Prerequisites: Need the data file from the ABS - electorates_ageSingleYears_sex_longform.csv.
# To do:
# - Add an overview
# - Make it into a markdown doc
# Misc:
# -


#### Set up workspace ####
library(arm) # Need to invert the logistic
library(lme4) # Need for the model
library(tidyverse)
# update.packages()


#### Create example polling data ####
# We want to generate some sample data that we'll analyse. The advantage of this is that we have some idea of what to from the model.
# Just two variables for now (we'll add more later):
# is_male, which is 0 for females and 1 for males (IRL we'd need a third category for 'Other or prefer not to answer'); and
# in_age_group, which is one of four groups: 1, 2, 3, 4 (IRL this corresponds to something like: 18-29, 30-45, 45-60, 60+, and, again, we'd need a 'Other or prefer not to answer' category)
example_poll <-
  tibble(
    is_male = sample(c(0, 1), 2000, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.75, 0.25)), # deliberately over-sample females
    in_age_group = sample(c(1:4), 2000, replace = TRUE)
  )

# Let's make males and older people less likely to vote for the ALP in our sample; and females and younger people more likely to vote for the ALP..
example_poll <- example_poll %>%
  mutate(
    binomial_param = case_when(
      is_male == 0 & in_age_group ==  1 ~ 0.9,
      is_male == 0 & in_age_group ==  2 ~ 0.7,
      is_male == 0 & in_age_group ==  3 ~ 0.5,
      is_male == 0 & in_age_group ==  4 ~ 0.3,
      is_male == 1 & in_age_group ==  1 ~ 0.7,
      is_male == 1 & in_age_group ==  2 ~ 0.5,
      is_male == 1 & in_age_group ==  3 ~ 0.3,
      is_male == 1 & in_age_group ==  4 ~ 0.1,
      TRUE ~ 0.5
    )
  ) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(supports_ALP = rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, prob = binomial_param))

write_csv(example_poll, "outputs/data/example_poll_data.csv")

#### Analyse example polling data ####
# Now we'd like to see if we can get our results back - should find females less likely than males to vote ALP and that people are less likely to vote ALP as they get older.
example_model <-
  glmer(
    formula = supports_ALP ~ (1 | is_male) + (1 | in_age_group),
    data = example_poll,
    family = binomial(link = "logit") # Use this because supports_ALP is a binary
  )

summary(example_model)
ranef(example_model)
# Thankfully we find what we're looking for.


#### Post-stratify ####
# Now we'd like to see if we can use what we found in the poll to get an estimate for the seats.
# First read in some real demographic data, on a seat basis, from the ABS.
example_data <-
  read_csv("inputs/data/electorates_ageSingleYears_sex_longform.csv", skip = 8)
# The wonderful ABS allows us to download data in long format, so we only need to do some minor tidying and aggregating before we're ready to go.

# Fill the rows and just keep the bits with content that we can work with
example_data <- example_data %>%
  fill(division, age) %>%
